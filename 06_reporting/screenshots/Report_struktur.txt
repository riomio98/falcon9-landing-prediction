Final Exam Reporting Pack (Repository + Presentation)

This document gives you a ready-to-use structure for your GitHub repository and a slide-by-slide outline for your PDF presentation. All content below is in the order you should present it.


1) Repository Structure (GitHub)

Use this tree to organize the deliverables. Do NOT delete your original numbered folders; link to them from the new folders as shown.

Mapping to your existing content:
- 01_datenerfassung → notebooks/01_data_collection.ipynb (link) and src/data/
- 02_data_wrangling → notebooks/02_data_wrangling.ipynb (link) and src/data/
- 03_exploratory_Data_analysis → notebooks/03_eda.ipynb (link)
- 04_vizualisation → notebooks/04_visualization.ipynb (link) and src/visualization/
- 05_model_training → notebooks/05_modeling.ipynb (link) and src/models/

Tip: Keep heavy files out of Git. Store only small samples in data/raw and add a data/README.md with download instructions.


2) Presentation Outline (PDF)

Slide 1 — Title & Executive Summary
- Project name, your name, date

- Small table: raw → processed rows/columns
- Link to wrangling notebook

Slide 5 — EDA Highlights (Visual)
- 2–3 key charts with 1-line insights each
- Why these charts (relationship, distribution, trend)

4) How to export to PDF (Slides)
Option A — VS Code
1. Open reports/presentation/outline.md and add your images to reports/presentation/figures.
2. Use a Markdown-to-PDF extension (e.g., Markdown PDF) to export slides.pdf.

Option B — Browser Print

2. Print to PDF (A4 or 16:9, include backgrounds).

Option C — PowerPoint/Google Slides
1. Copy the outline into slides, paste images.
2. Export as PDF and save as reports/presentation/slides.pdf.


5) Quality Checklist (before submission)
- README.md explains the project and points to slides.pdf
- reports/presentation/slides.pdf opens and all images are visible
- Notebooks run top-to-bottom on your machine
- requirements.txt installs without errors
- No large data files tracked in Git; data/README.md explains how to fetch


6) Appendix — Detailed Content Prompts (optional)

You can reuse the bullets below to quickly fill slides and the written report:
- Flight Number vs. Launch Site — scatter: what pattern does site show?
- Payload vs. Launch Site — scatter: any thresholds where success changes?
- Success Rate vs. Orbit Type — bar: which orbits have highest success?
- Flight Number vs. Orbit Type — scatter: maturation across orbits?
- Payload vs. Orbit Type — scatter: optimal payload ranges by orbit?
- Yearly Trend — line: how has success changed over time?
- SQL: unique launch sites, sites starting with CCA, payload totals and averages, first successful landings, filtered successes, outcome counts, max payload boosters, 2015 failures, ranked outcomes in a period.

For modeling:
- List candidate algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN)
- Show hyperparameters tuned and metric used (e.g., F1-score)
- Confusion matrix interpretation: which classes are confused and why
